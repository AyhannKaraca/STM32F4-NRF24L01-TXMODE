# STM32F4-NRF24L01-TXMODE
Configuring the NRF24L01 module as a transmitter using the STM32F4 board.

I configured the NRF24L01 module as a transmitter with the STM32F407 DISC board and set up the same module as a receiver with an Arduino Uno, aiming to establish communication between the two. The code on the Arduino side was copied from a well-known library, while the code on the STM32 side was written by me. The main goal here was to use and better understand the SPI protocol. The module was configured in the simplest way. You can configure extra features (such as Enhanced ShockBurst and AutoAck) to ensure data transmission security or reliability.
